//Let's create an array that stores 2 hands of poker

//First we define the array
var hands = [];

//We need two items in this array - one for each player.
//Each hand should contain 5 arrays, one for each card. 
//Each card array should specify the suit and rank of the card. 
//e.g. [6,"C"] for a 6 of clubs
hands[0] = [[6,"C"], ["A","D"], [2,"H"], ["J","S"], [2,"S"]];
hands[1] = [[5,"C"], ["K","D"], [3,"H"], ["Q","S"], [2,"S"]];
